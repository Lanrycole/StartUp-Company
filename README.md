# StartUp-Company


This Java program is was built by me. The program is  a company management tool which allow users to add, delete and find employees by thier names or employee number. 

This program was built following the 4 pillars of Objct Oriented program: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction and Encapsulation. 
Also, I used Java Swing and AWT to develop the GUI. 

Please feel free to use any part of this code. Knowledge survives when it is propagated.
